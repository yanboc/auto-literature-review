2005.10190,Feature Purification: How Adversarial Training Performs Robust Deep Learning,Zeyuan Allen-Zhu; Yuanzhi Li,"Despite the empirical success of using Adversarial Training to defend deep learning models against adversarial perturbations, so far, it still remains rather unclear what the principles are behind the existence of adversarial perturbations, and what adversarial training does to the neural network to remove them.
  In this paper, we present a principle that we call Feature Purification, where we show one of the causes of the existence of adversarial examples is the accumulation of certain small dense mixtures in the hidden weights during the training process of a neural network; and more importantly, one of the goals of adversarial training is to remove such mixtures to purify hidden weights. We present both experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset to illustrate this principle, and a theoretical result proving that for certain natural classification tasks, training a two-layer neural network with ReLU activation using randomly initialized gradient descent indeed satisfies this principle.
  Technically, we give, to the best of our knowledge, the first result proving that the following two can hold simultaneously for training a neural network with ReLU activation. (1) Training over the original data is indeed non-robust to small adversarial perturbations of some radius. (2) Adversarial training, even with an empirical perturbation algorithm such as FGM, can in fact be provably robust against ANY perturbations of the same radius. Finally, we also prove a complexity lower bound, showing that low complexity models such as linear classifiers, low-degree polynomials, or even the neural tangent kernel for this network, CANNOT defend against perturbations of this same radius, no matter what algorithms are used to train them."
2210.09221,Vision Transformers provably learn spatial structure,Samy Jelassi; Michael E. Sander; Yuanzhi Li,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved comparable or superior performance than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision. This empirical breakthrough is even more remarkable since, in contrast to CNNs, ViTs do not embed any visual inductive bias of spatial locality. Yet, recent works have shown that while minimizing their training loss, ViTs specifically learn spatially localized patterns. This raises a central question: how do ViTs learn these patterns by solely minimizing their training loss using gradient-based methods from random initialization? In this paper, we provide some theoretical justification of this phenomenon. We propose a spatially structured dataset and a simplified ViT model. In this model, the attention matrix solely depends on the positional encodings. We call this mechanism the positional attention mechanism. On the theoretical side, we consider a binary classification task and show that while the learning problem admits multiple solutions that generalize, our model implicitly learns the spatial structure of the dataset while generalizing: we call this phenomenon patch association. We prove that patch association helps to sample-efficiently transfer to downstream datasets that share the same structure as the pre-training one but differ in the features. Lastly, we empirically verify that a ViT with positional attention performs similarly to the original one on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN and ImageNet."
2409.17625,Benign Overfitting in Token Selection of Attention Mechanism,Keitaro Sakamoto; Issei Sato,"Attention mechanism is a fundamental component of the transformer model and plays a significant role in its success. However, the theoretical understanding of how attention learns to select tokens is still an emerging area of research. In this work, we study the training dynamics and generalization ability of the attention mechanism under classification problems with label noise. We show that, with the characterization of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the token selection of attention mechanism achieves benign overfitting, i.e., maintaining high generalization performance despite fitting label noise. Our work also demonstrates an interesting delayed acquisition of generalization after an initial phase of overfitting. Finally, we provide experiments to support our theoretical analysis using both synthetic and real-world datasets."
