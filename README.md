Here we introduce an **automatic assistant for literature review** with integrated AI capabilities that can generate a paper list based on user-provided source references and automatically organize & save AI-generated literature summaries. More importantly, since the entire project's codebase is very concise (~200 lines), you can easily add the features you need. (Click [here](./README_CH.md) for Chinese version.)

The main features of the current version include:

1. **(Build a target paper database)** We maintain a list of *accepted papers from past AI conferences (2022-2025)* obtained from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) (see `assets/datasets.csv`). Based on this list, we clean and organize the metadata of target papers (including titles, authors, abstracts, PDFs, keywords, etc.) into a **target paper database**.
2. **（Parse Source Literature）** Users need to provide the arXiv id of source papers. The system can automatically retrieve the metadata of source papers based on arXiv id.
3. **（Initial Screening Based on Title and Abstract）** We estimate the similarity between source papers and target papers based on [Sentence Transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers).
4. **（AI/Agentic Features - To Be Implemented）** For articles after initial screening, we will use AI capabilities to summarize PDF full texts (output in `markdown` format) and perform further comparison on the summarized articles, thereby generating a more precise list of relevant literature.
5. **（Query Records - To Be Implemented）** After a complete literature query, the system will store necessary information for subsequent viewing or further analysis.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Step 1. Download Data from 🤗

The dataset information containing paper metadata is manually saved in `assets/datasets.csv`. To expand the search scope, please add entries to this file as needed. After running

```bash
python3 src/fetch.py
```

data files in the format `{conf_name}-{conf_year}.csv` will be generated in the `data` folder, along with a summary file named `target_papers.csv`, which contains the titles, abstracts, and author information of all papers.

### Step 2. Parse Source Paper Information

Subsequent similarity calculations require metadata of source papers (including titles, authors, abstracts, etc.). You can automatically parse paper metadata by providing the *arXiv* id of papers:

```bash
python src/parse_sources.py
```

Alternatively, you can manually fill in the information following the example template in `configs/example_source_papers.csv` (rename the file to `configs/source_papers.csv` after filling it in).

### Step 3. Initial Screening Based on Title and Abstract

Run the following command to perform similarity calculation and ranking:

```bash
python src/rank.py
```
